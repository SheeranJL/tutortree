# TutorTree Application Assessement

## The objectives
This project follows the format of the XD files to the best of my ability, strictly adhering only to the design prototype.

A few notes:

- When contrasting my solution to XD, you may notice that the border colour for the buttons, and modal don't match exactly with my solution. XD states that the purple border colour for the post buttons and modal input borders is rgba(117, 16, 247, 1). However, when actually using an eye-dropper tool to inspect the true colour, it's rgba(150, 75, 247, 1). I cannot explain this discrepency but I chose to use the colour the XD files described rather than using the true eye-dropper color.

- As the task wanted me to stay as close to the original design as possible - I did not include any additional functional or styling features beyond that which was strictly dictated within the prototype. This was on purpose in case you're wondering why I didn't add a modal close button for example or an edge case for no user-input.
